# The admin panel: setting it up

`https://openresults.zerotwo.cloud/admin` is where the operator moderates
public publishing. This document is for the person switching it on: what to
click in Keycloak and in Cloudflare, which three variables to set on the
server, how to check it worked, how to sign out, and what each kind of
misconfiguration looks like.

The contract behind it is the "Admin panel: `/admin`" section of
[`public-publishing.md`](public-publishing.md). The code is
`OpenResultsWeb.Plugs.AdminAuth` and the modules under
`lib/openresults_web/admin_access/`.

## How the lock works

Two locks, and each one alone opens nothing.

1. **Cloudflare Access**, at the edge. An Access application covers
   `openresults.zerotwo.cloud/admin*`. Nobody reaches the server on those
   paths without signing in through Keycloak and being in the Keycloak group
   `openresults-admin`.
2. **The app itself.** Cloudflare attaches a signed token to every request
   it lets through (`Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion`). The app verifies that token
   against Cloudflare's published keys, checks it was issued for *this*
   Access application and *this* team, and checks the email in it against its
   own list, `OPENRESULTS_ADMIN_EMAILS`.

The second lock is there because an Access policy is a form in a dashboard,
and forms get edited wrong. If the Access application is deleted, its path is
mistyped, or its policy is widened while testing, the panel stays shut: a
request without a valid token for this application gets the site's ordinary
"Not Found".

This app still talks to no identity provider itself. Keycloak is Cloudflare
Access's identity provider, not this app's; there are no accounts or
passwords here.

## Before you start

You need:

- admin rights in the Keycloak realm that Cloudflare Access signs people in
  with;
- admin rights in Cloudflare Zero Trust for the `zerotwo.cloud` account;
- root on the host, to add three environment variables.

Your **team domain** is shown under **Zero Trust → Settings → Team name and
domain**. It looks like `<team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com`. You need it twice
below. (Renaming the team later changes it, and the panel then answers "Not
Found" until the variable is updated too.)

## 1. Keycloak: the group, and groups in the token

If Keycloak is already an identity provider in Zero Trust for other
applications, its client exists; do only the group and the mapper check.

1. **Create the group.** Realm → **Groups → Create group**, name
   `openresults-admin`. Add the people who should administer the site
   (**Users → the user → Groups → Join group**). Each needs an email address
   set on their Keycloak user: that address is what reaches the app.
2. **The client, if there is none yet.** **Clients → Create client**, type
   *OpenID Connect*, a client ID such as `cloudflare-access`, **Client
   authentication** on. Valid redirect URI:
   `https://<team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback`.
   Copy the client secret from the **Credentials** tab.
3. **Put the groups in the token.** **Clients → the Cloudflare client →
   Client scopes → the `…-dedicated` scope → Add mapper → By configuration →
   Group Membership**:
   - **Name**: `groups`
   - **Token Claim Name**: `groups`
   - **Full group path**: **off** (otherwise the value is
     `/openresults-admin`, and the policy below will not match it)
   - **Add to ID token**, **Add to access token**, **Add to userinfo**: on

## 2. Cloudflare: Keycloak as an identity provider

Skip this if Keycloak is already listed under **Zero Trust → Integrations →
Identity providers**, but check that its **OIDC Claims** include `groups`.

Otherwise: **Zero Trust → Integrations → Identity providers → Add new
identity provider → OpenID Connect**.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `Keycloak` |
| Client ID | the client ID from step 1 |
| Client secret | the secret from step 1 |
| Auth URL | `https://<keycloak host>/realms/<realm>/protocol/openid-connect/auth` |
| Token URL | `https://<keycloak host>/realms/<realm>/protocol/openid-connect/token` |
| Certificate URL | `https://<keycloak host>/realms/<realm>/protocol/openid-connect/certs` |
| PKCE | on |
| OIDC Claims | add `groups` |

Save, then use **Test** on the provider: sign in as one of the admins and
check that the result shows `groups` containing `openresults-admin`.

## 3. Cloudflare: the Access application for `/admin`

**Zero Trust → Access controls → Applications → Add an application →
Self-hosted** (in some dashboards: *Self-hosted and private → Add public
hostname*).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Application name | `OpenResults admin` |
| Session duration | `8 hours` (shorter is fine; this is how long a sign-in lasts) |
| Subdomain | `openresults` |
| Domain | `zerotwo.cloud` |
| Path | `admin*` |
| Identity providers | **Keycloak only**; *Apply instant authentication* on, so the Access login page is skipped |

**The path is `admin*`, not `admin/*` and not `admin`.** Cloudflare's path
rules are literal about this: `admin/*` covers `/admin/tournaments` but *not*
`/admin` itself, and `admin` without a wildcard covers only `/admin`. `admin*`
covers `/admin`, `/admin/` and everything beneath it. (It also covers any
other path starting with "admin"; the public site has none.)

Add one policy:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Policy name | `openresults-admin group` |
| Action | **Allow** |
| Include | selector **OIDC Claims** (shown as *IdP OIDC Claim* in some dashboards), claim name `groups`, claim value `openresults-admin` |
| Require (optional) | selector **Login Methods**, value `Keycloak` |

No other policy. In particular no *Bypass*, no *Service Auth* and no
*Everyone* rule on this application: a service token has no email and the app
would refuse it anyway, and a bypass would leave only the second lock.

Save the application. The existing tunnel route for `openresults.zerotwo.cloud`
(see [`deployment.md`](deployment.md)) does not change; Access sits in front
of it for the `/admin*` paths only, and every public page stays exactly as
open as it was.

## 4. The Application Audience (AUD) tag

**Zero Trust → Access controls → Applications →** `OpenResults admin` **→
Configure → Additional settings → Application Audience (AUD) Tag.** Copy it:
a long hexadecimal string.

It identifies this one application. A token Cloudflare issued for any other
Access application in the same team carries a different AUD and is refused.
Deleting and re-creating the application gives it a **new** AUD, and the
variable must be updated.

## 5. The three variables

As a systemd drop-in, not in `openresults.service` itself: the deploy
rewrites the unit on every run and would wipe hand-added lines (see
"Secrets" in [`deployment.md`](deployment.md)).

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/openresults.service.d/admin.conf
[Service]
Environment="OPENRESULTS_ADMIN_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN=<team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com"
Environment="OPENRESULTS_ADMIN_ACCESS_AUD=<the AUD tag>"
Environment="OPENRESULTS_ADMIN_EMAILS=first.admin@example.org,second.admin@example.org"
```

```bash
chmod 600 /etc/systemd/system/openresults.service.d/admin.conf
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart openresults
journalctl -u openresults -g "admin panel" -n 5
```

| Variable | What it is |
|---|---|
| `OPENRESULTS_ADMIN_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` | the team domain from "Before you start". With or without `https://` and a trailing slash; anything that is not a plain host name counts as unset |
| `OPENRESULTS_ADMIN_ACCESS_AUD` | the AUD tag from step 4 |
| `OPENRESULTS_ADMIN_EMAILS` | comma separated, spaces around commas ignored, compared case-insensitively. The exact address Keycloak has for each admin |

**All three or nothing.** With any one missing, every `/admin` path answers
"Not Found" exactly as a page that does not exist. A club's own copy of
OpenResults, which sets none of them, therefore has no admin panel at all.

After the restart the journal should say:

```
[info] admin panel: enabled behind Cloudflare Access
```

## 6. Checking it works

Do all of these once, after setting it up and after changing anything in
Access.

1. **An admin gets in.** In a private window open
   `https://openresults.zerotwo.cloud/admin`. Keycloak's sign-in appears (or
   Cloudflare's, if instant authentication is off); after it, the dashboard
   says **Signed in as** your address, and **Checked by** says *Cloudflare
   Access, and this server's own check of the Access token*.
2. **Someone outside the group does not.** Sign in as a Keycloak user who is
   not in `openresults-admin`. Cloudflare shows its own access-denied page;
   the request never reaches the server.
3. **Someone in the group but not on the list gets a 403.** Temporarily
   leave one admin's address out of `OPENRESULTS_ADMIN_EMAILS` (or test with a
   third group member). They see a plain page: *Forbidden - Signed in as ...,
   which is not on this server's list of administrators.* Put the address
   back.
4. **The app's own lock holds without Access.** On the host, bypassing
   Cloudflare entirely:

   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:4004/admin
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -H 'Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion: forged' http://127.0.0.1:4004/admin
   ```

   Both must print `404`. The journal shows
   `admin panel: refused GET /admin (no_access_token)` and `(malformed)`.
5. **The admin pages are never stored or framed.** In the browser's developer
   tools, on the dashboard's response: `cache-control: no-store`,
   `x-frame-options: DENY`, and a `content-security-policy` ending in
   `frame-ancestors 'none'`.
6. **The public site is unchanged.**

   ```bash
   curl -sI https://openresults.zerotwo.cloud/ | grep -i set-cookie
   ```

   prints nothing.

## Signing out

**Sign out**, top right, goes to `/cdn-cgi/access/logout` on this hostname.
Cloudflare answers that address itself: it ends the Access session and clears
its cookie, and the next visit to `/admin` goes back through Access's sign-in.

What it does not end is **Keycloak's own session**. Keycloak may still
remember you, in which case the next visit to `/admin` signs you straight back
in without asking for a password. On a shared or borrowed machine, also sign
out of Keycloak (its account console,
`https://<keycloak host>/realms/<realm>/account`, **Sign out**), or close the
browser.

The panel's own cookie, `_openresults_admin`, holds only a form token and
one-off messages. It says nothing about who you are and ends with the browser
session; who is signed in is re-checked from Cloudflare's token on every
request.

## Using the panel

Everything that changes something goes through a confirmation page that says
what will happen, then a button. Nothing needs JavaScript. Every change is
written to the action log with your address.

- **Dashboard.** The two switches, what needs attention (pending tournaments,
  open reports), what published tournaments take on disk, and the latest
  actions. **Pausing public publishing takes arbiters' live updates offline
  in the middle of their events**: every tournament published from
  OpenPairings desktop stops updating until you resume. Tournaments published
  with the operator token are not affected. When
  `OPENRESULTS_PUBLIC_PUBLISHING` is not enabled the dashboard says so, and
  the switches are stored but change nothing.
- **Tournaments.** Filter by status, open reports or a search. A tournament's
  page shows its owner, first and last publish, snapshot sizes, its reports
  and what has been done to it. Approve (pending to listed), hide, unhide,
  transfer to another installation by its `in_...` id (this clears the
  tournament key, so that installation's next publish claims it), or delete
  (every stored version and the entry list with its email addresses; it
  cannot be undone).
- **Installations.** Suspend (its key stops publishing until unsuspended),
  unsuspend, or revoke (final; you choose whether to hide its tournaments
  too). Addresses show as "forgotten after 30 days" once retention has
  cleared them.
- **A laptop restored from backup** comes back as a new installation, because
  no OpenPairings backup carries the installation key. On the old
  installation's page, **Move all tournaments to another installation…** takes
  the new one's id and shows its client, version and when and where it was
  last seen, so you can check it is the right laptop, then moves every
  tournament at once. Each one's tournament key is cleared, so the new
  laptop's next publish claims it. A suspended or revoked installation cannot
  receive them.
- **Reports.** The open queue, each report with a link to its tournament,
  and Resolve with a written resolution. Resolving does not change the
  tournament; hide or delete it separately.
- **Address blocks.** An address or CIDR range, for a number of hours or days
  (at most 30), with a reason. Before you confirm, the page shows how many
  installations were seen from that range in the last 30 days: a club's wifi
  can be many people.
- **Action log.** Everything above, plus break-glass uses of the operator
  token and retention runs, filterable by who, what and target.

## When it does not work

Every refusal of a configured panel is logged with its reason (never with the
token). Start with:

```bash
journalctl -u openresults -g "admin panel" -n 20
```

| What you see | Log | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| "Not Found" on every `/admin` path | at boot: `admin panel: OFF, every /admin path answers 404 - missing or unusable: …` | a variable is missing, empty, or (team domain) not a host name. The line names which |
| "Not Found", no log at all | nothing | none of the three variables is set: the panel is off, as on every club's own copy |
| "Not Found" | `refused GET /admin (no_access_token)` | the request did not come through Access: no Access application covers this path, its path is `admin/*` or `admin`, or it is disabled. The app stayed shut, but fix Access |
| "Not Found" | `(wrong_audience)` | `OPENRESULTS_ADMIN_ACCESS_AUD` is another application's tag, or the application was re-created and has a new one |
| "Not Found" | `(unknown_key)`, often with `could not fetch Cloudflare Access certs for …` and an HTTP status or connection error | the team domain is wrong (another team's, a typo, or the team was renamed), or the host cannot reach `https://<team domain>/cdn-cgi/access/certs` (outbound HTTPS, DNS) |
| "Not Found" | `(wrong_issuer)` | the keys matched but the token names a different issuer: the configured team domain is not the exact `<team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com` shown under Settings → Team name and domain |
| "Not Found" | `(expired)` or `(not_yet_valid)` | the server's clock is off by more than a minute: `timedatectl` |
| plain "Forbidden - Signed in as …" | `"…" passed Cloudflare Access but is not in OPENRESULTS_ADMIN_EMAILS` | that address is not on the list. Compare it with the Keycloak user's email |
| Cloudflare's own access-denied page | nothing (the request never arrived) | the Access policy refused: not in the group, the `groups` mapper missing or with *Full group path* on, or `groups` not listed under the provider's **OIDC Claims** |
| the service does not start | `refusing to start: the admin panel's development bypass is configured …` | `:admin_dev_bypass` reached production configuration. Remove it; it belongs in `config/dev.exs` only |

### Signing keys

The app fetches Cloudflare's signing keys from the team domain and keeps them.
It fetches again when a token names a key it has not seen (Cloudflare rotates
keys every six weeks) and when its copy is more than an hour old - but never
more than once every 30 seconds, whatever the requests say, so a flood of
made-up tokens cannot turn the server into a request generator aimed at
Cloudflare. If a fetch fails, the keys already held stay in use.

In practice that means one visible effect: in the first 30 seconds after the
server has just fetched keys, a token signed with a brand-new key is refused
("Not Found", `unknown_key`). Reloading a moment later works.

## Local development

`config/dev.exs` turns on a development bypass: on `mix phx.server`, `/admin`
signs you in as `admin@localhost` with no Cloudflare in front, and says so in a
banner on every page. It exists only in development and test configuration,
is never read from an environment variable, is ignored outside those two
environments, and a production start with it configured refuses to boot.
