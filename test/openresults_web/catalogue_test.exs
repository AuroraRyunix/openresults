  The catalogues themselves, checked the way a compiler would.

  `OpenResultsWeb.LocaleTest` already asks the two questions a reader would
  notice at once: is anything still in English, and is anything carrying
  gettext's own guess. Everything here is the layer under that - the ways a
  catalogue can be wrong while every message in it looks perfectly fine.

  Each one is a class of defect, not an instance. They were added after the
  translations audit of 2026-09-12, and the two that found something on the
