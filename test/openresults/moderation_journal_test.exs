defmodule OpenResults.ModerationJournalTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A restore must not undo moderation (restore drill, finding 2): after the
  backup the drill's operator revoked a key, closed registration, paused
  publishing, blocked a range and deleted a tournament, and an arbiter withdrew
  one - and the restored site had undone every one of them.

  `OpenResults.ModerationJournal` keeps those actions outside the database and
  applies them again at boot. The test that carries the weight does what the
  drill did: a real database, a real backup, every kind of action through
  `OpenResults.Moderation` (and an owner's withdrawal through the API's own
  path), a real `Backup.restore/1`, and the boot's replay run against the
  restored file through the app's own Repo.
