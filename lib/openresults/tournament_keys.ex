defmodule OpenResults.TournamentKeys do
  @moduledoc """
  Which machine is allowed to touch which tournament.

  There are two questions on the write path and they are not the same
  question:

  | | asked by | answers |
  |---|---|---|
  | the ingest token | `OpenResultsWeb.Plugs.IngestAuth` | may this machine talk to this server at all |
  | the tournament key | this module | may it touch THIS tournament |

  Before this existed there was only the first one, which meant a single
  shared secret let anything holding it overwrite any tournament on the
  server, including one it had never published - and, once the delete route
  arrived, remove one. Publishing rights over `gent-spring-open-2026` and
  publishing rights over somebody else's event are different grants, so they
  are now different secrets.

  ## Trust on first use

  The arbiter's machine generates a random key per tournament and sends it
  with the first publish. That publish CLAIMS the slug: the digest is stored
  and every later publish, and any delete, must present the same key.

  This is TOFU, with everything TOFU implies - the server takes the first
  claimant's word for it, because at that moment there is nothing else to
  check it against. Two reasons that is the right trade here rather than a
  hole:

  1. **The first question is already answered.** With the operator token,
     the claimant is not the public; it is a machine an operator deliberately
     configured. The exposure this guards is ACCIDENT - two arbiters' laptops
     picking the same obvious slug for two different events, one silently
     flattening the other - rather than attack.
  2. **The alternative is an account system.** Verifying a claim needs an
     identity to verify it against, and this app deliberately has no accounts,
     no sessions and no cookies. Adding them so that a slug could be
     pre-registered would cost the whole read-side design to close a gap the
     ingest token already narrows to configured machines.

  ## Installation keys, where the claimant IS the public

  Public publishing (`docs/public-publishing.md`) broke reason 1. An
  installation key is handed to any OpenPairings copy that asks, so a publish
  carrying one comes from whoever that is - and TOFU against the public, on
  slugs the public chooses, is squatting: register a key, publish to
  `gent-open-2026` before its arbiter does, and the claim is yours.

  What makes TOFU safe again is not in this module - it is that an
  installation never gets to choose, or reach, a slug that could already mean
  something:

    * **The server mints the slug.** `POST /api/tournaments` picks nine random
      bytes and binds the slug to the installation that asked
      (`OpenResults.Tournaments.mint/2`). No readable name can be requested.
    * **An installation key touches only its own slugs.** Every route checks
      the binding before this module is asked anything, and the publish path
      checks it again inside the transaction that stores the snapshot. An
      operator-published slug, a legacy slug with no key, another
      installation's slug and a slug never minted are all `not_owner`.

  So the only slug an installation's first keyed publish can claim is one
  created for that installation moments earlier, and there is nobody else it
  could be taking it from. TOFU is back to guarding the case it was written
  for: the owner's own machine, and a key that must not change under it.

  Break-glass is never available to an installation credential - see below.

  ## A publish carrying no key

  Allowed, and the slug simply stays unclaimed.

  This is the additive-only rule from `docs/snapshot-schema.md` applied to
  authentication instead of to fields. Snapshots already exist in
  production-shaped databases from before any of this, so slugs exist that
  have published for a season and have no key; and OpenPairings laptops in the
  field will not learn to send one until their arbiters update, which they do
  when they feel like it. Refusing a keyless publish would take those
  tournaments off the air mid-event, and the arbiter would find out in the
  hall.

  So there is no backfill and no admin step. **A legacy slug is adopted by the
  first publish that carries a key** - the same TOFU path a brand-new slug
  takes, which is why there is only one path. Until that happens the slug
  behaves exactly as it did before this module existed.

  The protection is not weakened by that, because claiming is one-way: once a
  slug HAS a key, a keyless publish to it is refused (`:key_required`). An old
  client cannot take a claimed tournament over by simply omitting the header,
  which would otherwise make the whole thing decorative. The cost is that an
  arbiter who claims a slug and then DOWNGRADES to a client that cannot send
  keys is locked out - deliberately, and that is what break-glass is for.

  ## Break-glass

  A key lives on one laptop. Laptops die, and a tournament whose key died with
  it would be unpublishable and undeletable forever, which is a worse failure
  than the one this module prevents.

  So a request may present the SERVER-WIDE INGEST TOKEN in the tournament-key
  position and the key check is overridden. That is a deliberate act - an
  operator has to go and paste the server's master secret where a per-event
  secret belongs - so it cannot happen by accident, and it grants nothing the
  token holder could not already do by editing the database by hand. Every use
  is logged at warning level with the slug and the action, and written to the
  moderation action log with `break-glass` as the actor
  (`OpenResults.Moderation`), where the admin panel shows it.

  Only when the request authenticated with the operator token. A request that
  authenticated with an installation key passes `break_glass: false`, and then
  the operator token in the key header is just a wrong key. Otherwise the
  master secret would be one header away from a credential the public holds -
  harmless while nobody has both, and exactly the kind of property that stops
  holding the day somebody does.

  Break-glass never claims a slug. Storing a hash of the server-wide token as
  a tournament key would quietly promote the master secret into a per-event
  one, and then rotating the ingest token would lock out every tournament
  claimed that way.
