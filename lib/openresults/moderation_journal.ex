defmodule OpenResults.ModerationJournal do
  @moduledoc """
  A record of every moderation action that made the site safer, kept OUTSIDE
  the database, so that restoring a backup cannot undo it.

  ## Why

  The restore drill of 2026-09-13 restored a backup after the operator had
  kept working, and measured what came back (`docs/restore-drill-2026-09-13.md`,
  finding 2): a revoked installation's key minted a slug again, closed
  registration issued a key, a blocked range registered, a tournament deleted
  for personal data was back with its history, and a tournament its arbiter had
  withdrawn from OpenPairings was online again with its entry form open. The
  action log is restored to the same instant, so it could not say what to
  re-apply, and an owner's withdrawal was never in it at all.

  ## The file

  Beside the database, in the same directory, named after it:
  `/var/lib/openresults/openresults-moderation.jsonl`. Not inside the database,
  so a backup never contains it and a restore never touches it.
  `config :openresults, :moderation_journal` is a path to put it elsewhere, or
  `false` for none (the test environment).

  One JSON object per line, appended after the action committed:

      {"v":1,"at":"2026-09-13T10:02:11.123456Z","action":"hide","target":"gent-open"}
      {"v":1,"at":"...","action":"delete","target":"gent-open","by":"owner"}
      {"v":1,"at":"...","action":"revoke","target":"in_XWtJ...","hide_tournaments":true}
      {"v":1,"at":"...","action":"suspend","target":"in_XWtJ..."}
      {"v":1,"at":"...","action":"block_address","cidr":"192.0.2.0/24","expires_at":"..."}
      {"v":1,"at":"...","action":"put_setting","target":"registration_open","value":false}
      {"v":1,"at":"...","action":"put_setting","target":"public_publishing_paused","value":true}
      {"v":1,"at":"...","action":"untrust","target":"in_XWtJ..."}
      {"v":1,"at":"...","action":"lower_limits","target":"in_XWtJ...","limits":{"max_versions":5,"max_tournaments":null}}

  **Only the safer direction is journalled**: `delete` - the admin panel's,
  and an owner's or the operator's `DELETE /api/tournaments/:slug` (`by` says
  which) - `hide`, `revoke`, `suspend`, `block_address`, closing registration
  and pausing publishing, and (the admin upgrade, 2026-09-13) ending an
  installation's trust (`untrust`) and lowering its own limits
  (`lower_limits`: only the limits whose value in force went down, each with
  the installation's own value afterwards, `null` for the server's). Approve,
  unhide, unsuspend, unblock, opening registration, unpausing, granting trust
  and raising a limit are never written, so never replayed: after a
  restore they stay as the backup had them, and the operator redoes them
  deliberately. `at` is the action log row's own time where there is one.

  What a line holds: a slug, an installation id, a switch - and for a block,
  the address or range and its expiry, exactly what the action log already
  keeps for it. Not the block's reason, which is free text an operator typed;
  a replayed block says it was kept in force after a restore instead.

  ## Replay

  `replay/1` runs at every boot, after migrations, before the endpoint starts
  (`OpenResults.Application`). For every line it re-applies the action if -
  and only if - the database does not already know about it:

    * `delete`: if anything is still held for the slug that is OLDER than the
      line (a snapshot, a registration, the key claim, the tournament row),
      the database predates the delete, and the slug is purged again
      (`OpenResults.Takedown.purge/1`). A tournament published again under the
      slug after the delete is newer than the line, and stays.
    * `hide`, `suspend`, and the two switches: if the action log has any row
      about the same target at or after the line's time - the action itself,
      a later reversal, an earlier replay of this line or a later one (a
      replay's row counts by its `journal_at`) - the database already reflects it,
      and nothing happens. Otherwise the change is made if it is not already
      in force. A `hide` is also passed over when a later line deleted the
      slug.
    * `revoke`: revoked is final, so an installation that is not revoked is
      revoked (hiding its tournaments too if the original did).
    * `block_address`: as the others, keyed on the range; never re-created
      once its expiry has passed, and not twice.
    * `untrust`: as `suspend` - passed over when the action log has a row
      about the installation at or after the line; otherwise a trusted
      installation's trust is cleared.
    * `lower_limits`: passed over the same way; otherwise every journalled
      limit whose value in force is still HIGHER than the journalled one
      (a blank counting as the server's value now) is set to it. A limit
      already as low or lower is left alone.

  Every re-applied action writes one action log row with the actor
  `restore-replay` and the line's time in `journal_at`, which is also what
  makes the next boot see it as known. On a boot that followed no restore,
  every line is known and nothing happens.

  ## Trimming

  `trim/1` drops lines older than the oldest backup that could still be
  restored - the retention window plus a week's margin, or the oldest backup
  on disk less that margin if it is older (the newest backup is kept whatever
  its age). A restore cannot bring back anything older, so they can only ever
  be known. It runs after each boot's replay and after each scheduled backup.
  A backup copied off the box and kept longer than that is outside what this
  covers; the deployment guide says so.
