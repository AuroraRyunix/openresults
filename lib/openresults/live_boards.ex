defmodule OpenResults.LiveBoards do
  @moduledoc """
  Live boards: the games of a round, move by move, as a hall relay reports
  them. The contract a relay implements is `docs/live-boards-api.md`.

  ## What is stored, and where it comes from

  The snapshot (`OpenResults.Snapshots`) says who sits where and what the
  arbiter has published. This module holds the other half: what is happening
  on a board right now. They are joined on `(round, board)` at read time and
  never merged - a live game is never part of a snapshot, so a publish cannot
  wipe it and a live update cannot change a published result.

  ## Ingest

  `ingest/3` is idempotent and tolerant of order. It is keyed by
  `(slug, round, board)` and decided by the ply count:

    * an update with a LOWER ply than the stored one is ignored (`applied:
      false`) - the relay's retry of an old message must not undo a newer one;
    * an update with the SAME ply refreshes clocks, status and result, and
      must agree with the moves already held;
    * an update with a HIGHER ply extends the game, and must extend it - the
      stored moves have to be a prefix of the new list;
    * `replace: true` is the full-game resend: it replaces whatever is held,
      keeping only the stored plies that are still identical, so their
      timestamps (and with them the broadcast delay) survive a resend.

  Every move is checked for legality from the start position (or the given
  `start_fen`) by `OpenResults.Chess`; a list with an illegal move is refused
  whole, naming the ply. Only the plies that are new are replayed through the
  engine - the stored ones carry their own positions - so a relay that sends
  the whole list every time costs a string comparison per old ply.

  ## The broadcast delay

  Organisers may be required to delay what spectators see. Ingest always
  stores real time: each ply records when it was heard. `view/3` is the one
  door every page reads through, and it shows the game as it stood
  `delay` ago: the plies heard by then, the clocks as they were with them,
  and no result before its time. Nothing past the cutoff reaches a page.
