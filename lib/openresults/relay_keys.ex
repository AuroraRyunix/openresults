defmodule OpenResults.RelayKeys do
  @moduledoc """
  Relay keys: the credential a hall relay carries instead of anything that
  could rewrite a tournament.

  A relay is a box in a playing hall. It can be lost, stolen, or left on a
  shelf in a venue's cupboard for a year. The operator token and an
  installation key both reach far more than "report what is on the boards";
  a relay key reaches exactly that.

  ## What one may do

  `POST /api/tournaments/:slug/live` for the one tournament it was made for.
  Nothing else: not another slug, not a publish, not history, not delete, not
  the admin panel. `OpenResultsWeb.Plugs.IngestAuth` refuses it with the
  anonymous 401 on every route that has not opted in with
  `private: %{relay_access: true}`, and `OpenResultsWeb.RelayAccess` holds the
  checks of the one that has. The tournament's own key is something the relay
  must not hold, so on that route a relay key stands in for it.

  ## The key

  `orrk_` and 43 characters: 32 random bytes, base64url. Shown once, on the
  page that created it; the server keeps the SHA-256, found through a unique
  index, for the reasons `OpenResults.Installations` gives. Revoking sets a
  timestamp rather than deleting, so the list can say what was revoked and
  when, and a revoked key is told so rather than treated as a stranger.

  Creating and revoking are the admin panel's, and are logged as
  `relay_key_create` / `relay_key_revoke` with the key's id and label. The
  secret never reaches the log.
