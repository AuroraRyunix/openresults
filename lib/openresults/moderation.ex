defmodule OpenResults.Moderation do
  @moduledoc """
  Everything the admin panel does, and the log of it.

  The names and arities here are a contract: `docs/public-publishing.md`,
  "Moderation API". The panel is built against that section and only renders
  what these return, so a rename here is a broken panel.

  ## Actors

  `actor` is `%{email: String.t()}` - the address the panel's own
  authentication established. Anything else raises: a moderation action with
  nobody behind it is a bug in the caller, not an input to tolerate.

  ## The action log

  Every function that changes something writes one `OpenResults.Moderation.Action`
  in the same transaction as the change, so there is no change without its
  entry and no entry for a change that rolled back. Three kinds of entry are
  written from outside this module's functions, each with its own actor:

    * `break-glass` - `OpenResults.TournamentKeys`, when the operator token was
      presented where a tournament key belongs;
    * `retention` - `OpenResults.Retention`, the daily job;
    * `restore-replay` - `OpenResults.ModerationJournal`, at boot, for an
      action a restored backup had undone and that was applied again.

  ## The moderation journal

  The actions that make the site safer - `delete`, `hide`, `revoke`,
  `suspend`, `block_address`, closing registration, pausing publishing - also
  append a line to `OpenResults.ModerationJournal` once they have committed:
  a file outside the database, which a restore cannot take back.

  ## Return shapes

    * a changed tournament, installation, report or block comes back as
      `{:ok, struct}`;
    * a refusal is `{:error, atom}` - `:not_found`, `:invalid_status`,
      `:already_resolved`, `:installation_revoked`, `:unknown_setting` - or
      `{:error, %Ecto.Changeset{}}` where there is a form to redisplay
      (`block_address/4`);
    * `delete/2` returns `{:ok, counts}`, the same counts
      `DELETE /api/tournaments/:slug` answers with.

  Tournament listings carry three virtual fields filled from other tables:
  `name` (from the current snapshot, `nil` before the first publish),
  `last_published_at` and `open_reports`. Installation listings carry
  `tournament_count` (`pending` plus `listed`, the number the limit counts).
