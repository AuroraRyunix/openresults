defmodule OpenResultsWeb.StatsTelemetry do
  @moduledoc """
  The two telemetry handlers that feed `OpenResults.Stats`, attached once at
  boot by `OpenResults.Application`.

  ## `[:bandit, :request, :stop]`, not Phoenix's endpoint event

  Bandit's event fires for every response it sends, including the static
  assets `Plug.Static` answers before `Plug.Telemetry` in the endpoint ever
  runs, and the 400s for requests too malformed to reach a plug. It runs in
  the connection's own process after the response has gone, so it adds no
  latency to the request it counts - only CPU, which is what
  `OpenResults.Stats` keeps to one counter increment (two on a tournament
  page). The page cache's decision arrives in `conn.private`, put there by
  `OpenResultsWeb.Plugs.Revalidate`, and rides in the same increment.

  ## What is looked at

  The method, the path's first segment, the status, the duration and - for a
  tournament page - its slug and the visibility `OpenResultsWeb.Plugs.Visibility`
  assigned. Never the address or the query string.

  A tournament page is counted in "busiest tournaments" only when that
  visibility says something has published under the slug (`:pending` or
  `:listed`) and the page answered 2xx or 304, so a scan of made-up slugs -
  `:none`, and a 404 - adds nothing.

  ## Views against refreshes

  A public tournament page polls its own URL every 20 seconds so a reader
  watching it sees updates without reloading (`root.html.heex`, and the
  projector board in `tournament_html.ex`) - one reader with a tab open for a
  couple of hours can throw hundreds of these at a slug that never had
  hundreds of visitors. Only a genuine navigation is counted as a view; a
  poll is counted separately, as a refresh (`OpenResults.Stats.record_refresh/3`).

  The distinction reads at most two request headers, only on a tournament
  page that already reached the visibility check below - never on a request
  that would not be counted at all:

    * the refresher's own `fetch()` calls send `x-openresults-refresh: 1`.
      Same-origin, so no CORS preflight. Whatever `Sec-Fetch-Mode` says, its
      presence alone means a poll.
    * otherwise, `Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate` (a browser loading the page,
      including inside another site's `<iframe>`) means a view; any other
      value (`cors`, `same-origin`, `no-cors` - a script's own `fetch`,
      an on-page peek like the player-card popup) means a poll.
    * a request with no `Sec-Fetch-Mode` at all - older browsers, most
      non-browser clients, some bots - is counted as a view. That
      slightly over-counts a scripted client working through the API-less
      HTML pages, which this cannot tell from a real reader without the
      header; it is the same trade `Sec-Fetch` support itself makes.

  Publishes, mints and registrations are recognised here from their route and
  success status, so the controllers that do them are not touched; refusals
  are counted where the refusal body is built, `OpenResultsWeb.ApiError`.

  ## `[:open_results, :repo, :query]`

  Ecto's per-query event, for query time and the time spent waiting for a
  pool connection - the queue that emptied in the 2026-09-12 incident.

  ## Never raises

  `:telemetry` detaches a handler that raises, for good. Everything a handler
  here reads is matched with a fallback, and `OpenResults.Stats` swallows a
  missing table.
