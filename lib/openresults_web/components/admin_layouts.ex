  The admin panel's own root layout, and nothing borrowed from the public one.

  The public layout carries a theme picker, a language picker, a 20-second
  refresher and a player-card script. None of that belongs here, and all of
  it is JavaScript this panel promises not to need. What it keeps is the
  stylesheet and the mark, so it still looks like the same site - and an
  inverted bar with an ADMIN badge, so it is never mistaken for a public page.

  English only, on purpose: the panel has two users. Its text is not wrapped
  in gettext and should not be.
