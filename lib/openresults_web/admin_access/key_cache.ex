defmodule OpenResultsWeb.AdminAccess.KeyCache do
  @moduledoc """
  Cloudflare Access's signing keys, fetched from the team domain and kept.

  ## The policy

  - **Read without asking anyone.** A known `kid` whose key set is fresh is
    an ETS lookup in the request's own process.
  - **Refetch on an unknown `kid`**, once, then answer. Cloudflare rotates
    its signing key every six weeks (the certs document carries the current
    and the previous key), and a token signed with a key this cache has not
    seen yet is what a rotation looks like from here - the one moment a
    fetch is worth making.
  - **Refetch a key set older than an hour** on the next request that uses
    it, so a key Cloudflare has withdrawn stops being accepted here too
    rather than living until the next restart.
  - **Never more than one fetch per `refetch_interval`** (30 s), however many
    requests ask. The `kid` comes from the request, so without this a stream
    of made-up `kid`s would turn this server into a request amplifier
    pointed at Cloudflare. Inside the interval an unknown `kid` is simply
    unknown.
  - **Hold the keys through a failed fetch.** Cloudflare being unreachable
    for a minute must not lock the admins out when the keys already held
    still verify their tokens. A failure is logged and changes nothing.

  Every fetch happens inside this process, so a burst of requests that all
  miss waits for one fetch and then reads its result, instead of each
  starting its own.

  ## The fetcher

  `:admin_access_jwks_fetcher` in the application environment, a
  `fn team_domain -> {:ok, decoded_jwks} | {:error, reason} end`. Unset, it
  is `fetch_jwks/1`, which uses `Req` like `OpenResults.FideLookup` does.
  Tests put a function there, so no test touches the network.
