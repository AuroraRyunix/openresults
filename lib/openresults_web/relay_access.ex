defmodule OpenResultsWeb.RelayAccess do
  @moduledoc """
  What a relay key may do: `POST /api/tournaments/:slug/live` for its own
  tournament, and nothing else.

  Called only from `OpenResultsWeb.Plugs.IngestAuth`, with a key it has
  already recognised, and only on a route that opted in with
  `private: %{relay_access: true}`. A route that did not gets the anonymous
  401 before this module is asked, so a relay key reaching somewhere new
  takes a change in the router, not an omission.

  ## Order

  Revoked, then the key's own budget, then address block, then the operator's
  pause, then whether the path's slug is the key's. Cheap first, as for an
  installation key. The slug check comes last and answers
  `relay_key_wrong_tournament`: the key's holder learns it is pointed at the
  wrong place, a stranger learns nothing, because a stranger has no key.

  The budget is per KEY, not per tournament or address: two boxes in one hall
  must not spend each other's allowance, and a runaway one must not be able
  to starve the other.
