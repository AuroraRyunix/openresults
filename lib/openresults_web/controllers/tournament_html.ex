  rows show and in what order, and `OpenResultsWeb.Components.FilterBar` for
  the form itself.

  `rank` is always the arbiter's own placing, printed in its own column,
  whatever `filters.sort` reorders the rows to - never recomputed here, and
  never affected by which rows are hidden: this page exists to agree with
  the printed crosstable, not to re-rank against it. When a category filter
  is active each row also shows its place WITHIN that category, from
  `Filter.standings/2`'s `places` map - see that function's own moduledoc for
  exactly how that number is derived.

  ## Why this is a server-side filter, unlike the site's other search boxes

  `index.html.heex`'s tournament search and (before this change) this very
  table's club/federation/category dropdowns filter client-side, and their
  own comments explain why: it keeps `OpenResultsWeb.Plugs.Revalidate`'s
  page cache trivially valid, because every reader of one URL always got
  byte-identical HTML.

  The filter bar breaks that assumption on purpose - a `?category=U1800`
  request must render fewer rows, in real HTML, so the page works with no
  JavaScript at all and a filtered link is what a reader can actually send
  someone. `Revalidate.call/2` is where the trade is made: a request
  carrying any filter/sort key bypasses the page cache entirely rather than
  polluting it with a key space bounded only by how creative a query string
  can get - see that module's own moduledoc for the decision in full.

  @doc """
  The cross-table: a row per player, a column per published round.

  What every other results site has and this one did not. It answers the
  question the standings and the round pages between them make a reader
  assemble by hand - who did this player actually play, and what happened -
  and it is the first thing an arbiter looks for.

  ## The columns

  Only PUBLISHED rounds, so an arbiter who has posted 1, 2, 3 and 5 gets four
  columns and no gap where 4 would be. That is the opposite of the round
  strip in the masthead, which shows the gap on purpose: a strip is a list of
  what exists, and this is a table of results, where an empty column would
  read as a round nobody turned up to.

  And only rounds the published standings already cover -
  `Tournament.within_standings?/2` again narrows "published" the same way it
  does for `Tournament.crosstable/1` itself, so a round already live but not
  yet folded into the standings beside this grid gets no column here either,
  even though its own page already shows it.

  Each heading links to that round's own page, which is where the boards,
  the ratings and the scores going in are.

  ## The two columns that stay put

  The pairing number and the name are pinned to the left edge while the
  rounds scroll under them. A 450-player, eleven-round grid is wider than
  any screen, and a reader who has scrolled to round 9 without them is
  looking at a wall of numbers belonging to nobody. Everything else about
  the width is `.scroller`'s job - the table scrolls inside its own box and
  the page body never moves sideways.

  ## What a cell is not

  Not the board's result token. `1-0` is a win for one seat and a loss for
  the other, so each cell carries the score of the player whose ROW it is -
  see `OpenResultsWeb.Tournament.crosstable/1`, where the split happens.

  ## The filter bar filters ROWS only

  `filters` (see `OpenResultsWeb.Tournament.Filter.crosstable_rows/3`)
  narrows which players get a row here - never the columns, and never the
  opponent numbers inside a cell: an opponent is named by their overall
  pairing number whether or not that opponent's own row is currently
  shown, exactly as it was before this feature existed. There is no sort
  control on this page - see `crosstable_rows/3`'s own moduledoc for why
  re-ordering these rows at all would fight the reason they are in
  starting-number order in the first place.

  A board STAYS in the table when either seat's player matches the active

  A round's boards, projected: readable from across a room, and left to the
  script below to page through when they do not all fit on the screen in
  front of them.

  Reached via `?display=1` on the round's own URL, so this is the same
  document as `pairings_table/1` above and not a separate page - see
  `TournamentController.round/2`. Two differences from the ordinary table:
  every name is plain text rather than a link, because a tap here pauses the
  cycle rather than following it somewhere; and there is no rating or score
  column, because a hall screen must never need to scroll sideways to find a
  board, and neither serves what a projector is actually for - finding your
  name and seeing who you are playing.

  Byes are listed underneath, statically - useful to a player checking
  whether they are even on a board, and deliberately NOT part of the cycle,
  same as standings: nobody watches a hall screen for their own bye.

  The pagination itself is client-side JavaScript, and has to be: this is a
  plain controller with no socket, and a hall screen must keep cycling
  through a venue's wifi wobbling, not stop the moment it does.

  One picture of a player's tournament: what each round contributed to a
  tie-break, and how their own score climbed.

  Both series are in POINTS, which is the only reason they can share an axis.
  A dual-scale chart that put a running total and a per-round contribution on
  different axes would let the two cross wherever the scaling happened to put
  them, and the crossing would mean nothing.

  The bars are the tie-break's own published contributions - the strength of
  the field this player actually faced, which is what a Buchholz IS. A bar
  the arbiter's rules did not count (discarded by a cut, or below Koya's
  threshold) is drawn in the withheld colour rather than left out, because
  "that round did not help you" is the interesting part.

  Inline SVG, no library: this site ships one stylesheet and one script, and

  A result token, with its forfeit or unrated marker spelled out.

  A game with no result yet is a hyphen rather than a blank, because a blank
  cell in a pairing list reads as a board nobody has typed in, which is a
  different thing from a game still in progress.

  A postponed game - one the arbiter paired and the players will play later,
  `boards[].postponed` - says so in words instead, with the date the players
  agreed when there is one. The caller passes the date only where the
  arbiter's "dates" tick allows it (see `postponed_date/2`), because it is the
  same kind of fact as a round's date, which that tick already hides. Once
  the game is played the next snapshot carries its result and no flag, and
  the token simply takes the label's place.
