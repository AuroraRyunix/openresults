  The public pages: standings, the cross-table, one round, one player.

  Each action does the same three things - fetch the current snapshot, refuse
  what is not in it, hand the payload to a template. There is no query beyond
  `Snapshots.latest/1`, because everything a page shows was decided on the
  arbiter's machine and travelled whole.

  A 404 here is a real answer, not a failure. An unpublished round is absent
  from the payload, so `/round/4` on a tournament whose arbiter has published
  rounds 1-3 and 5 has nothing to render, and saying "not published" is more
  honest than an empty table that looks like a round nobody turned up to.
