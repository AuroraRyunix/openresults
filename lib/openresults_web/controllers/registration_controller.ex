  The public entry form.

  The only place a member of the public can write to this server, and what it
  writes to is a QUEUE. Nothing here touches a tournament. The arbiter's
  machine pulls the queue and the arbiter decides who plays, exactly as with a
  paper entry form left on a table at the club - which is why every word on
  these two pages is careful never to say "you are entered".

  A tournament has to have published here before anybody can enter it. That is
  not a convenience check: a registration for `gent-spring-opne-2026` would
  otherwise sit in a queue no arbiter will ever pull, and this app is not
  allowed to invent a tournament from an entry. The 404 is the same one the
  standings page gives, for the same reason.

  Both actions run on the read pipeline, so like every other page on this site
  they set no cookie. See the router for why a form here needs neither a
  session nor a CSRF token, and what protects it instead.

  The arbiter's pull: every entry this server holds for `slug`.

  Token-gated, and sitting alongside `/history` rather than beside the open
  read routes, because this is the ONE thing in the system that carries an
  email address. Everything a spectator can reach was chosen for publication
  by an arbiter; this was typed by a member of the public who expected the
  organiser to read it, and nobody else.

  The shape is a 1:1 render of the stored row rather than a bare array of
  payloads: the arbiter's machine has to tell one entry from another across
  repeated pulls so a discarded entry does not come back every time, and `id`
  is the only stable handle for that. A bare array would leave the client
  hashing the document to invent one.

  This server still never decides anything. It has no notion of an entry
  being "handled" - that is a fact about the arbiter's machine, and it is
  kept there. So this returns everything, every time, and is safe to call
  repeatedly.
