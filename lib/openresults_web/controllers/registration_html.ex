  Hand written against this app's own stylesheet, like the tables are. The
  scaffold's `<.input>` in `core_components.ex` is styled for daisyUI, which
  `assets/css/app.css` dropped on purpose - tens of kilobytes of component
  library for a site made of four tables and one form, loaded over a playing
  hall's wifi - so using it here would produce controls with class names
  nothing defines.

  The form itself.

  No `phx-` anything and no JavaScript: this page has to work on the phone of
  somebody standing in a corridor with one bar of signal, and a plain form
  post does. Validation is therefore entirely on the server, and the errors it
  returns have to be worth reading, because a round trip is what they cost.

  Every field is optional except a name and an email. That is not laziness
  about data quality - it is club chess. A player with no rating, no
  federation, no FIDE ID and no club is the ordinary case, and a form that
  demanded them would turn "not known" into "cannot enter".
