defmodule OpenResultsWeb.Admin.InstallationController do
  @moduledoc """
  Installations: the list, one installation, and suspend, unsuspend and
  revoke - each a confirmation page and the POST behind it.

  Revoking asks what happens to the installation's tournaments and has no
  default answer. Hiding a club's live event and leaving a spammer's pages up
  are both mistakes a pre-ticked box would make for somebody.

  ## Moving every tournament

  The restore case (`Moderation.transfer_all/3`): no OpenPairings backup
  carries the installation key, so a restored laptop registers as a new
  installation and its tournaments have to follow it. One path, as always:

    * `GET .../move-tournaments` - which tournaments would move, and a field
      for the installation to move them to;
    * `GET .../move-tournaments?to=in_...` - the confirmation page, which
      shows that installation's client, version and when and where it was
      last seen, so the operator can tell it is the right laptop before
      anything moves. A GET, because an installation id is nothing a URL
      should not carry;
    * `POST .../move-tournaments` - the move, confirmed.
