defmodule OpenResultsWeb.SnapshotController do
  @moduledoc """
  Ingest and read-back of published snapshots.

  Four routes. `create` is the trust boundary and is token-gated. `show`
  serves the CURRENT document and is open, because that document contains
  nothing that was withheld - the withholding happened before it was built.
  `history` serves earlier documents and is token-gated, which is the whole
  point of the split. `delete` removes the tournament entirely.

  `create` and `delete` are also gated per-tournament, by the key in the
  `x-openresults-key` header - see `OpenResults.TournamentKeys` for what that
  key is and why it is a second question rather than a stronger version of the
  first. Two different failures, and they get two different statuses on
  purpose: **401** is "you may not talk to this server", from the plug on the
  pipeline, and **403** is "you may, but not to this tournament".

  The key travels in a HEADER and never in the payload. It could not go in the
  document even if the contract wanted it to: `payload` is stored whole and
  verbatim, and `show` serves that column to the public, so a key inside it
  would be written to disk in plaintext and then published on a page. The
  snapshot describes a tournament; credentials belong to the transport, beside
  the bearer token.

  Withholding holds for the current document ONLY. The table is append-only,
  so an earlier row can contain a round the arbiter has since RETRACTED - a
  wrong result entered, republished without it - or a board they have since
  hidden. Serving those by timestamp on an open endpoint hands back exactly
  what the arbiter withdrew, and it was reproducible: publish rounds 1,2,3,5,
  retract round 3, and `?at=` returned round 3 with its boards intact while
  the page one link away correctly 404'd.

  That is the same failure OpenPairings shipped this week - a backup
  restoring every hidden board into view - through a different door. The
  append-only table is right and stays; its public reachability was the bug.

  `POST /api/snapshots` - accepts a published snapshot.

  The first publish carrying a key claims the slug; every later one must

  this existed - and laptops running a client too old to send a key - on the
  air. `OpenResults.TournamentKeys` has the reasoning.

  Everything: every snapshot including the history, the registration queue,

  removed only the current snapshot would be a bug that reports success.

  Answers 200 with the counts even when nothing was there, because delete is
  idempotent and a client retrying after a timeout should not have to tell a
  404 that means "already gone" from a 404 that means "you typed the slug
  wrong". The counts distinguish those without making the retry an error.
