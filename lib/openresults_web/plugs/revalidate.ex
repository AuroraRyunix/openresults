  Answers "has this tournament changed since you last asked" without reading
  the tournament.

  ## The cost this removes

  Every page here is a plain request that loads the published snapshot and
  decodes it. On a 300-player, 11-round event that document is ~580 KB of
  JSON and the decode is about 17 ms of CPU - and the page refreshes itself
  every 20 seconds, per spectator, so a hall full of phones pays that
  repeatedly for a document that only changes when the arbiter publishes.

  The snapshot table appends one row per changed publish and collapses a
  byte-identical re-send, so **the newest row's id IS the version**. Asking
  for the id alone is a primary-key lookup; if the reader already has that
  id, the answer is `304 Not Modified` and the payload is never touched.

  ## Why not let the CDN hold it

  Cloudflare sits in front of this site and currently caches nothing
  (`cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC`), which is a real cost - but making the page
  publicly cacheable would mean a spectator could be handed a standings page
  that was correct thirty seconds ago, and there is no worse failure for a
  results site than a stuck page somebody trusts. Deliberately rejected by
  the maintainer on those grounds.

  So the header is `private, no-cache`: not "do not store", but "always ask
  first". The reader revalidates on every poll and gets the new page the
  instant it exists, while an unchanged one costs a primary-key lookup
  instead of half a megabyte of JSON.

  ## Why the tag is keyed

  The ETag is also the page cache's key, so two URLs that produce the same
  tag are one page as far as this site is concerned. It used to be a bare
  `phash2` of the path and query string - public, deterministic, unkeyed and
  27 bits wide - which meant a query string colliding with a target page's
  tag could be worked out offline in seconds, and the collision would then
  serve one page's body under the URL a legitimate reader asks for.

  It is now an HMAC under a value drawn once per boot, so there is nothing
  to compute against: the input nobody outside this node holds is the secret.
  Bounded even when it did collide - the tournament, the snapshot id and the
  locale are separate parts of the cache key, so a collision could never
  cross tournaments, outlive a publish or surface a 404 or a withheld page.
  Defacement inside one tournament, not disclosure.

  ## The filter bar and the page cache

  `?category=U1800`, `?sort=rating` and the rest of
  `OpenResultsWeb.FilterParams`'s query keys change what a page RENDERS -
  see `OpenResultsWeb.Tournament.Filter` - which `Page`'s own contract
  ("every reader of one URL gets byte-identical HTML") was never written to
  allow. The ETag digest already includes the raw query string (see
  `etag_for/3` below, unchanged by this), so a filtered request and the
  plain one could never collide or shadow each other even before this - the
  problem is not correctness, it is the KEY SPACE: `Page.put/5` bounds each
  tournament to 512 entries and wipes the lot when a busier one is
  published, `?category=U1800`, `?category=u1800` and `?category=U1800&x=1`
  each earning their own entry for what a reader would call one filter.
  That is real capacity a stranger typing query junk can burn through,
  repeatedly evicting a tournament's warm cache for every OTHER reader.

  Two ways to close that were on the table: key `Page` on a NORMALISED
  filter (fold every filtered request to one canonical query string first,
  so the key space is bounded by real filter combinations rather than by
  what a client can type), or never let a filtered request touch `Page` at
  all. This plug takes the second: `filtered?` in `revalidate/2` below is
  the whole decision, one guard clause rather than a second key shape for
  `Page` to learn. A filtered response still renders correctly and still
  answers a matching `If-None-Match` with a real 304 (see the `cond` below
  for why that half costs nothing to keep) - it is simply never read from
  or written to the ETS table, so `Page`'s key space stays exactly what it
  always was: bounded by how many distinct PAGES a tournament actually has,
  not by how many query strings a stranger can invent. An unfiltered
  request to the same path is untouched either way.

  ## What is not covered

  Only the read routes for a published tournament. The entry form is a form,
  the registration and snapshot APIs are authenticated, and none of them
  wants a browser deciding it already knows the answer.

  ## Compression

  Bandit will gzip a response on its own (`compress: true` is the library
  default) - except that it deliberately refuses to on any response carrying
  a *strong* ETag (see `Bandit.Compression.new/5`: a strong validator claims
  byte-for-byte identity, which a freshly gzipped stream cannot promise). This
  plug always sends a strong tag, so Bandit's own compression is silently
  off for every page this plug touches - confirmed with `curl -H
  "Accept-Encoding: gzip"` against a running server before this comment was
  written, not assumed.

  So compression is done here instead, once per publish rather than once per
  request: the moment a page is stored in `Page` (a cache miss), the gzip
  bytes are computed and stored alongside the identity ones under a second
  key. A cache HIT - the common case under load - then costs a lookup and a
  send either way, gzip or not; nothing is compressed on the request path
  itself. A reader whose `Accept-Encoding` does not mention gzip (or who asks
  before anybody has, i.e. the miss itself) gets the identity bytes exactly
  as before this change - this is additive, not a replacement of the default.

  `Vary: Accept-Encoding` is added (merged with `OpenResultsWeb.Plugs.Locale`'s
  own `Vary`, never overwriting it) because the response now genuinely
  depends on a second request header.

  # The PATH is part of the identity, not just the snapshot - one document

  # a round's own URL renders differently under `?display=1` (the projector
  # view), and without this a reader's `?display=1` request and somebody
  # else's plain one would share one ETag and shadow each other's page in
  # `Page` - whichever variant rendered first would be served to both.
  #
  # And the LOCALE, which is the one of the three that does not appear in the
  # URL at all: a reader whose browser asks for Dutch and a reader whose
  # browser asks for French request the same address and must not be handed
  # the same document. That matters here beyond the page cache - this string
  # goes to the browser as an HTTP validator, and a browser holding the Dutch
  # page must get a 200 rather than a 304 when it next asks in French.
  #
  # The path and the query string are the two an outsider chooses, so they go
  # through the MAC rather than a plain hash - see "Why the tag is keyed". The
  # id and the locale stay readable in front of it: they are already separate
  # parts of the cache key, and a tag one can read at a glance is worth
  # keeping for the afternoon somebody is reading a header dump.
  #
  # And the VISIBILITY, inside the MAC. A status change can change a page
  # without changing its snapshot id (it did while pending carried `noindex`,
  # until 2026-09-13), so a reader holding the page from before the change must
  # not be answered 304. `Page.forget/1` drops the stored bodies on the same
  # change; this is the half that reaches the reader's own cache.
  #
  # And the PUBLIC NOTICE's version, inside the MAC (the admin upgrade,
  # 2026-09-13). The operator's notice is on every page and belongs to no
  # snapshot, so setting, changing, clearing or expiring it changes every
  # page at once. Its version in the tag means a browser holding a page from
  # under another notice gets a 200, and - the tag being part of `Page`'s key -
  # no body rendered under another notice is ever served. `nil` when no notice
  # shows, which is how an expired notice stops matching with no admin action:
  # `OpenResultsWeb.Plugs.PublicNotice` compares the expiry with the clock on
  # every request. The bodies stored under an old notice's tags are not swept;
  # they are unreachable, bounded by `Page`'s per-tournament cap, and go at
