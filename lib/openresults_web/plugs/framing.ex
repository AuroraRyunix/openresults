  Lets a club site put these pages in an iframe.

  Phoenix's `put_secure_browser_headers/2` sets
  `content-security-policy: base-uri 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self'`, which is
  the right default for an application with a login. This site has neither a
  login nor a session, and being embeddable is one of the things it is for -
  a club front page showing its own tournament's standings is the ordinary
  case, not an edge one.

  The arbiter's app used to serve three embeddable public pages behind a
  careful argument about which routes qualified. Those pages moved here on
  2026-08-29 and the argument moved with them, but the header did not: the
  framework default silently blocked every embed, and nothing tested it - so
  the feature was reported as surviving the move when it had not.

  ## Why this is safe here and was not there

  Clickjacking steals authority the victim already holds: an invisible frame,
  a stray click, and something happens as them. Every page on this site holds
  none. There is no session, no cookie, nothing a visitor is signed in to,
  and the two things that write - the entry form and the FIDE search it
  borrows - take no authority from the visitor either. A framing page gains
  nothing it could not get by fetching the same URL itself.

  That argument covers the whole site rather than a list of routes, which is
  why this is a plug on the browser pipeline and not an opt-in a new route
  has to remember to ask for. The list was the fragile part last time.

  ## Configuring it

  `PUBLIC_FRAME_ANCESTORS`, default `*`. Set it to a space-separated origin
  list to restrict embedding to particular sites, or to `'none'` to switch it
  off entirely without touching the router.

  `base-uri 'self'` is left exactly as Phoenix set it. Only the one directive
  changes, so this cannot loosen anything else by accident.
