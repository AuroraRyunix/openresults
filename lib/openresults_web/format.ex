defmodule OpenResultsWeb.Format do
  @moduledoc """
  Locale-aware rendering for the two things a translated audit found were
  not translated at all: the decimal separator and the calendar.

  ## What this does not touch

  `en` is untouched, byte for byte - every function here falls straight
  back to today's behaviour (`Float.to_string/1`'s own `.`, the ISO date
  string verbatim) the moment the locale is not `nl` or `fr`. That is the
  scope the 2026-09-12 translations audit's findings 2 and 3 were approved
  for, not a limitation of the approach: nothing stops a later change from
  widening `@comma_locales` and giving `en` a month name of its own, but
  that is a separate decision.

  Nothing that is read back by a script or another program goes through
  this module. The standings sort reads `data-points`, `data-value` and
  `data-rating` straight off the payload and `parseFloat`s them - see
  `OpenResultsWeb.TournamentHTML.standings_table/1` and its own
  `standings_script/1` - and neither of those attributes is built from
  `number/2`. A `datetime` attribute, JSON, CSV or any other
  machine-readable surface would be the same: this module is for what a
  reader sees, never for what a program parses back.

  ## Why a comma and not a different notation

  The audit's own recommendation, and the one thing this module is
  deliberately narrow about: `5,5`, never `5½`. Chess federations in both
  languages write the fractional point with a comma and nothing else about
  how a score is expressed.

  ## Why gettext carries the month names

  `pgettext/2` under the `"month"` context, so a French or Dutch reviewer
  of the catalogues finds "augustus" and "août" sitting next to every other
  string this site ships rather than in a table only this module knows
  about, and the context keeps a msgid as ordinary as "May" from colliding
  with some unrelated one-word message that already exists.

  A number as `OpenResultsWeb.TournamentHTML.number/1` already renders it,
  with the fractional point swapped for a comma in `nl` and `fr`.

  Takes a string - the module that shapes the value (dropping a trailing
  `.0`, deciding what is not a number at all) is `TournamentHTML.number/1`;
  this only ever touches the separator. Reads the process's own Gettext
  locale when none is given, which is set for the whole render by
  `OpenResultsWeb.Plugs.Locale` before any template runs.

  An integer string has no `.` to find, so this is a no-op for a rating, a
  round number, a pairing number or any other count - exactly the values
  the audit said must never gain a comma.

  One date - `"2026-08-29"` - the way this locale writes it: day, month
  name, year. `en` returns the ISO string exactly as it arrived, which is
  what every caller already did before this module existed.

  A date this function cannot parse renders as it arrived rather than
  raising: the snapshot schema is additive-only and old payloads exist, so
  a value in some other shape must not take a public page down. Absent
  (`nil`) passes straight through for the same reason - callers that only
  want to render a date when there is one still do their own `&&` check,
  the same as they did for the raw ISO string before.

  years.

  `en` keeps rendering exactly the sentence it always has -
  `gettext("%{start} to %{finish}", ...)`, whose English catalogue entry is
  blank, so gettext answers with the msgid itself and the two ISO strings
  land in it unchanged. The same sentence is the fallback for `nl` and
  `fr` too, when either date fails to parse - already translated
  (`"%{start} tot %{finish}"`, `"%{start} au %{finish}"`), and exactly what
  a malformed pair rendered as before this module existed.
